## Installation

* Use Python 3.9 or later. For stability, our experiments work in `python==3.12.7`. Firstly, the `torch` installations need to be tailored to your machine's specific Cuda version. You can get the details in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) website. Then run the following code:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
